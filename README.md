# Fin’s MonARCH Quick Start Guide

This repository aims to help beginners to start using MonARCH
efficiently. The target audience is someone who doesn’t have experience
with Slurm or similar workload managers. This repo should serve as a
complementary resource to the [official
documentation](https://docs.monarch.erc.monash.edu/) rather than a
substitute.

The information provided here is based solely on my personal experience and reflects my own approach to using MonARCH. Whenever in doubt, refer back to the official documentation of [MonARCH](https://docs.monarch.erc.monash.edu/) and [Slurm](https://slurm.schedmd.com/documentation.html).
